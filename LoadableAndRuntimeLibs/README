Applications can use shared objects as loadtime or runtime libraries also refered as dynamic linking

- A libarary is refered to as loadtime if it is attached to process at loadtime

- A dynamic lib is refered to as runtime if it is attached to process space during application usage of that shared library or at execution

  Applications using dynamic linking need to be compiled with libdl which facilitates dynamic linking

  
      gcc MyAppUsingRunTimeLib.c -I. -ldl -o MyAppUsingRunTimeLib
